**America’s best hope**

*Why we would cast our hypothetical vote for Hillary Clinton*

Aquarter of Americans born since 1980 believe that democracy is a bad form of government, many more than did so 20 years ago. If the two main parties had set about designing a contest to feed the doubts of young voters, they could not have done better than this year’s presidential campaign. The vote, on November 8th, is now in sight, yet many Americans would willingly undergo the exercise all over again—with two new candidates. Of course that is not on oﬀer: the next president will be either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.

**X marks the spot**

The choice is not hard. The campaign has provided daily evidence that Mr Trump would be a terrible president. He has exploited America’s simmering racial tensions. His experience, temperament and character make him horribly unsuited to being the head of state of the nation that the rest of the democratic world looks to for leadership, the commander-in-chief of the world’s most powerful armed forces and the person who controls America’s nuclear deterrent.

  That alone would stop us from casting a vote, if we had one, for Mr Trump. As it happens, he has a set of policies to go with his personality. A Trump government would cut taxes for the richest while imposing trade protection that would raise prices for the poorest. We disagree with him on the environment, im- migration, America’s role in the world and other things be- sides. His ideas on revenue and spending are an aﬀront to sta- tistics. We would sooner have endorsed Richard Nixon—even had we known how he would later come to grief.
  Our vote, then, goes to Hillary Clinton. Those who reject her simply because she is a Clinton, and because they detest the Clinton machine, are not paying attention to the turpitude ofthe alternative. Although, by itself, that is not much ofan en- dorsement, we go further. Mrs Clinton is a better candidate
than she seems and better suited to cope with the awful, bro- ken state ofWashington politics than her critics will admit. She also deserves to prevail on her own merits.
  Like Mr Trump, Mrs Clinton has ideas we disagree with. Her tax plan is ﬁddly. Her opposition to the trade deal with Asia that she once championed is disheartening. The scale of these defects, though,  is measured  in  tiny increments compared with what Mr Trump proposes. On plenty of other questions her policies are those of the pragmatic centre of the Democrat- ic Party. She wants to lock up fewer non-violent oﬀenders, ex- pand the provision of early education and introduce paid pa- rental leave. She wants to continue Barack Obama’s eﬀorts to slow global warming. In Britain her ideological home would be the mainstream of the Conservative Party; in Germany she would be a Christian Democrat.
  In one sense Mrs Clinton is revolutionary. She would be America’s ﬁrst female president in the 240 years since inde- pendence. This is not a clinching reason to vote for her. But it would be a genuine achievement. In every other sense, how-
